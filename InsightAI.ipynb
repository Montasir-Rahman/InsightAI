            "The concept of agentic AI involves a cycle of perception, reasoning, goal setting, decision-making, execution, and learning. These systems can coordinate multiple specialized AI agents, with each agent handling a specific subtask, to tackle complex workflows. This collaborative approach allows for deeper domain-specific performance and greater scalability.\n",

            "There are different frameworks for categorizing the levels of agentic AI, often based on the degree of autonomy and complexity. While specific numbering may vary, these levels generally progress as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Level 1: Rule-Based Automation / Basic Responder / AI-Augmented Automation**: This foundational level involves systems that follow predetermined scripts or rules, with minimal intelligence. They might use LLMs for basic augmentation but primarily rely on fixed logic. Examples include simple chatbots or systems that classify and route emails.\n",
            "*   **Level 2: Machine Learning Integration / Router Pattern / Agentic Assistant**: These systems incorporate machine learning to assist with specific, deterministic tasks. They can understand limited context and adjust responses, with constrained decision-making capabilities.\n",
            "*   **Level 3: Partial Automation / Tool Calling / Plan and Reflect**: At this level, AI agents can perform more autonomous planning for well-defined use cases. They can select and execute tools to achieve defined goals and may involve human oversight. These systems are common in current production environments.\n",
            "*   **Level 4: High Automation / Multi-Agent Pattern / Self-Refinement**: This level involves more autonomous operation, where agents can learn from experience, generalize based on context, and coordinate with other agents. They may exhibit self-improvement capabilities, modifying instructions or creating new tools.\n",
            "*   **Level 5: Fully Autonomous / Autonomous Pattern**: Representing the highest degree of autonomy, often associated with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), these agents are capable of original thinking, problem-solving for unforeseen tasks, and operating without human intervention. This level is largely theoretical at present.\n"
